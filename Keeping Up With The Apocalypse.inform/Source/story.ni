"Keeping Up With The Apocalypse" by In√©s Peyser-Kreis

The Stairs In Front Of The Mansion is a room.

The description of The Stairs In Front Of The Mansion is "You wake up. It's not comfortable. You look around and realize that you're lying on the stairs in front of a big house, looking rather destroyed, north of you. Your house? You don't know at the moment.[Paragraph Break]To the south is a big courtyard. There are two impressive, but graffiti sprayed columns next to you and what used to be bushes."

The Courtyard is south of The Stairs In Front Of The Mansion.

The description of the Courtyard is "The courtyard is seamed with withered bushes. You see a fountain. Looking southeast, you can leave your property. Looking north are the stairs that lead you to your mansion."
